# InfiniteGoodsMod
Mod for Cities: Skylines. Commercial buildings never run out of goods to sell so that you don't need industry or import. Also, the same effect can be applied to industrial buildings so that you don't need specialized industry. Settings allow you to toggle which resources the mod is to take care of.
